## TODO

- Rename some functions names to be less confusing
- Telnet connection. Polish ssh and sftp, implement keytar.
- Logs for each device and network (Perchance, implement AI so you can ask it to provide you with specific data in the logs)
- Implement Electron for the desktop app version
- Users, permissions...
- Probably some more stuff that I cant think about of the top of my head rn...
