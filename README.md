# AdmiNetwork (WIP)
Administrate the available networks with this Electron web applicaton.

Scan all the available networks and its hosts, servers, virtual machines, retrieving advanced info like the operative system, open ports, active services...
Connect to any available host with SSH if possible.
Logs information about each host like the last ping, last ssh connection, active time...


info i need, todos...:

stop using xampp for database, move to MySQL, something centralized, expose it with OCI free tier.
wont expose the web, it will be a local web app that will scan the available network interfaces and send all the data to the database.
admin users will be able to see ALL the hosts of EVERY network, no matter where they connect from, since it will load all the data from the centralized database.
