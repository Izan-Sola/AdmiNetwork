TODO: 
  - Rename some functions names to be less confusing
  - Column to save ports, protocols and services of each host, display it on details...
  - SSH Connection with keytar to manage ssh keys
  - Logs for each device and network (Perchance, implement AI so you can ask it to provide you with specific data in the logs)
  - Implement Electron for the desktop app version
  - Users, permissions...
  - Probably some more stuff that I cant think about of the top of my head rn...
